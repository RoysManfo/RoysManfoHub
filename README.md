RoysManfoHub (RMHub or RMH) is a website where I will store my projects and apps.  
  
The whole website will use __Firebase Auth__ and probably __Firebase Firestore__ in order to create profiles for the users and sell some products.

## Info


### Framework
The language I will use to create RMHub is python, using the Django framework
<!-- More info about how is it built -->

### Privacy
<!-- I don't want any user data to be leaked -->

### Security
<!-- The site is protected by google -->

### Trackers
I use google Analitycs, but I don't have time to spy on YOU (I got thing to do dude, I'm not a weirdo).  
I use it just to know hom many users entered the website. That's it.
